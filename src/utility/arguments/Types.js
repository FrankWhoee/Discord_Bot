/*
    This looks like a very strange enum and it is, but for good reason.
    There are only 3 DataTypes in JavaScript, if you can call them that: String,
  Number and Boolean, where a Number is any real number. Thus telling the
  difference between an integer and a float is a bit tricky, since `typeof` will
  only tell us that it is a Number of some description.
    The way I get around this without creating a whole new case for integers and
  floats is by checking to see if `type.includes(typeof value)`. This way it is
  still possible to tell an integer from a float since
  `Types.Integer !== Types.Float` have different arrays, whilst both being able
  to be compared to the Number type.
